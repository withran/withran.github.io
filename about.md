# About Me

### 🌱 Background
- I’m a **Statistician** in the pharmaceutical industry, passionate about science, drug development, and health & medicine research.  
- I find my roots in math.
- You will find me always on my way to get a cup of coffee.
- My husband thinks I complain about life too much, but honestly, I feel I’m doing just fine as a mid-aged woman. 

As a statistician, I am interested in **Bayesian modeling**, **dynamic borrowing**, **risk-benefit assessment**, and innovative clinical trial designs to make drug development research smarter, faster, and more informative.  

As a drug developer, I am interested in tracking the landscape and chasing new findings in the field.

### 🔬 Professional Focus  
- **Goal**: Bridge rigorous statistical methods and practical decision-making in drug development.

# 💭 Thoughts on Drug Development

It’s been bothering me how resource-consuming the whole process of drug development is. I love the evidence-based way things are done — and as a statistician, that’s basically why I have such a good job — but it still feels crazy that it takes 10–12 years on average for a drug to go from discovery to approval.

I grew up in China, where herbal medicine has a long history and a lot of treatments are passed down through generations. Sometimes it’s literally, “your grandma heard from another grandma that this herb works.” I respect that kind of shared experience — it’s part of our culture — but at the same time, it always made me wondering how to validate evidence without rigorous science.

So I keep asking myself: **how can we make the whole process better?** No matter the starting point — traditional or modern — the goal is the same: get effective treatments to people faster, and make information sharing and tracking more open and complete.

Maybe the answer lies in using real-world data, data borrowing from existing knowledge, or seamless trial designs. I’ve been thinking and working a lot about seamless design and data borrowing lately, and it’s becoming a big focus for me.
