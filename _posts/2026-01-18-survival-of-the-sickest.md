# Notes on Evolution and Survival
**Date:** Jan 17, 2026  
**Mind Status:** Blown.

I finished *Survival of the Sickest* today. I’m not writing this to recommend it—I’m writing this because I need to get these thoughts down. As someone who works in drug development, I usually view disease as a "failure" of the system. This book makes me realize that sometimes, the "failure" is actually a feature.

### 1. The Logic of Bloodletting
This part finally clicked for me. I always thought bloodletting was just ancient medical nonsense. But the "ironing it out" section explained the trade-off. 

Bacteria need iron to thrive. By having an iron-deficient body (or even through historical bloodletting), we were essentially starving the infection. It’s a race against time: starve the bacteria enough to give the immune system a head start. Iron builds us up, but it also nourishes the enemy. I need to keep this concept of "nutritional immunity" in mind when thinking about how we design treatments.

### 2. Diabetes and the Ice Age
This feels like science fiction, but it makes so much sense. If humans survived an ice age, we needed a way to keep from freezing. Sugar is a natural anti-freeze. 

The fact that brain cells and brown adipose tissue don't need insulin is a huge "aha!" moment for me. The body was prioritizing: boost the glucose, keep the brain running, and keep the brown tissue active to generate heat. Evolution doesn't care if we have high blood sugar at age 60; it cares that we didn't freeze to death at age 16.

### 3. The Plant "Trap"
It’s funny to think we are "using" plants. It’s the other way around. 
* Celery has psoralens. 
* Soy has phytoestrogens. 

Plants are literally using chemical signals to manipulate the animals that eat them. It’s not just "food"—it’s a biological interaction. 

### Why this matters to me:
In my work as a statistician, I’m always looking for "clean" data. But biology is messy because it's full of these ancient trade-offs. We are living in bodies that are still optimized for the Ice Age and bacterial warfare. 

When I look at clinical trial designs now, I’m going to be thinking more about these underlying evolutionary pressures. The goal isn't just to "speed up" the process; it's to understand the system we are trying to change.
