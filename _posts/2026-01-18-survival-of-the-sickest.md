I finished *Survival of the Sickest* by Sharon Moalem.  As someone who works in drug development, I usually view disease as a "failure" of the system. This book makes me realize that sometimes, the "failure" is actually a feature.

### 1. The Logic of Bloodletting
This part finally clicked for me. I always thought bloodletting was just ancient medical nonsense. But the "ironing it out" section explained the trade-off. 

Bacteria need iron to thrive. By having an iron-deficient body (or even through historical bloodletting), we were essentially starving the infection. It’s a race against time: starve the bacteria enough to give the immune system a head start. Iron builds us up, but it also nourishes the enemy. 

### 2. Diabetes and the Ice Age
This feels like science fiction, but it makes so much sense. If humans survived an ice age, we needed a way to keep from freezing. Sugar is a natural anti-freeze. 

The fact that brain cells and brown adipose tissue don't need insulin is a huge "aha!" moment for me. The body was prioritizing: boost the glucose, keep the brain running, and keep the brown tissue active to generate heat. Evolution doesn't care if we have high blood sugar in 2026; it cares that our ancestors didn't freeze to death 12,000 years ago during the Younger Dryas.

### 3. The Plant "Trap": Are they taming us?
It’s funny to think we are "using" plants. It’s the other way around. Plants are using chemical signals to manipulate us and ensure their own survival:

* **Celery and Daylight Defense**: Celery produces psoralens to stop insects from eating them. It's genius—the chemical reacts with sunlight to cause "burns" on the predator. The plant uses the sun as its weapon.
* **Soy/Fava as Contraception**: These plants produce phytoestrogens. It’s not an accident; it’s a strategy to interfere with the fertility of animals like sheep. By acting as a natural contraceptive, the plants prevent the animal population from growing too large and eating them into extinction.

It’s not just "food"—it’s a sophisticated biological interaction.
